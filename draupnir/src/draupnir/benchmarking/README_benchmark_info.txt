DO NOT RUN THESE SCRIPTS, THEY DON'T WORK

 These scripts have not been cleaned neither documented very well, perhaps in the future. They rely on an old system of datasets distribution and they additionally need to have the results of the other
 state-of-the art methods to work, which I am not planning to upload since it's a lot of data.

 It is here just to give an idea of how the benchmarking was done

Contains the scripts utilized to

 a) perform benchmarking (benchmark.py)
 b) parse the results (parse_benchmark_results.py, FastML_Parser.py, IQTree_Parser.py)
 c) build comparison tables (merge_tables.py)
